# MyCarRental
In this project I wrote an API for car rental. I used postgresql as the database and queries for communicating with it.
The API enables you to manage the inventory by adding a car, removing a car and presenting the current inventory, to manage the car rentals by executing a rental, ending a rental and presenting the current rentals.
In the statistics section you can see some statistics of the rentals and cars in the program.

Enjoy!

# The languages I used:
* python (using Flask) for the main functionality of the program
* HTML for the structure of the program
* CSS for the design and looks of the program
